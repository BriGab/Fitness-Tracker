# Fitness Tracker

This is an application using Express, Mongoose, and deployed using Heroku. The application is started locally by running node server.js (after installing necessary npm packages found in package.json). The link to the deployed application is here:

For this project the front end code was given and it was our job to complete the Mongoose schema and the routes. There are options to continue adding excercises to existing workouts and creating a new workout. If you click on the top left corner on the fitness tracker dashboard you will get some graphs that compile the duration and weight you've entered for various workouts and then below which activities contributed to those. 

This is a great way to keep track of fitness goals and see compiled data.
